First we go into the U_Net_Interaction/ folder

Next we go into the Logistic_Regression_Interaction/ folder and run the code in the Interacting_With_Algorithm_LR.ipynb notebook to go about predicting the images and running the metrics on it

Next we go into the Linear_SVM_Interaction/ folder and run the code in the Interaction_With_Algorithm_Linear_SVM notebook to go about predicting the images and running the metrics on it
