We follow the instructions in the Interacting_with_Algorithm_U_Net.ipynb intructions which basically says to run the main_test.py file in the model folder

Then we run the matlab code prediction_images.m in the U_Net_Interaction folder and then we can run the rest of the code in Interacting_with_Algorithm_U_Net.ipynb

After we go back to the model_interaction/ folder
