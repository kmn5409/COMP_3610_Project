# COMP_3610_Project
In order to go about using this model you would first have to download the data from the [Massachusetts Roads Dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~vmnih/data/)

We provided some helper code we found on Kaggle that downloads the data from the website. So you would run
```
python3 run.py
```
to go about downloading the data

Next we go into the training folder to go about training our model
